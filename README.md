# Goofy CPU
A custom 8 bit cpu I made in logisim evolution.

It is still very WIP but currently its ALIVEEEEEEEE!

I have also made a second, more silly version [here](/goofier/README.md)!



## Instruction Set
The instructions can be found in the `plan.txt` file.

## Microcode
The cpus microcode is generated using a c# program I made.

It can be found in the `Microcode gen` folder.

## Developing

Currently the programs have to be directly set in ram.
